# Installer-4

Installer 4, a package manager for iPhoneOS 2
Original Source Code for Installer 4, with a few files removed due to legal reasons.

### What is this?

When we open sourced Installer 3, a lot of people wanted to know about Installer 4 too. 
After a decade, we are glad to be able to open source Installer 4.

Installer 4 was one of the two package managers for iPhoneOS 2 developed by Ripdev & Nullriver Software (company). It uses the AppTapp framework for managing packages.

### What is included?

Installer source code and Translation strings.

### What is missing?

There are some files (9) which were removed for legal reasons. We cannot open source them. If you want to get a feel for what they did feel free to ask us or decompile a executable =)

### Building

Installer 4 is an Xcode project. It builds on Xcode 3.2 with iPhone 2.0 SDK and later. You will have to modify the project settings for it to build on recent xcode versions. A separate version of Installer 4 which was edited to work on recent versions along with other changes will also be open sourced soon.
